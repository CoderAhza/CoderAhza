Yo! I'm Ahza ðŸ‘‹
Wassup fam? Iâ€™m Ahza, a dev whoâ€™s all about that tech life. Iâ€™m into coding and creating some cool projects, always on the grind to learn new things and level up. Right now, Iâ€™m cooking up some sick projects and diving deep into the latest tech. Youâ€™ll usually catch me vibing with JavaScript, Python, and exploring whatever new tools hit the scene.

Outside of coding, Iâ€™m lowkey obsessed with sportsand gaming. If youâ€™re into tech, want to collab, or just wanna vibe, hit me up. Iâ€™m always down to chop it up about coding, ideas, or just geek out on random stuff. Letâ€™s make something cool together! ðŸ’¬
